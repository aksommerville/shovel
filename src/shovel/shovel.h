/* shovel.h
 * Platform for games, with client providing framebuffers and PCM directly.
 * A shovel game has two segments: Main and Audio.
 * They're linked together natively, but in web are two independent Wasm modules.
 *
 * "sh_" functions are provided by the platform for clients to call. Comments will note which segments are allowed to call it.
 * "shm_" functions are implemented by the client's main segment.
 * "sha_" functions are implemented by the client's audio segment.
 * Names are deliberately terse, because they must be repeated a few times in the JS runtime.
 *
 * ===== Shovel ROM Format =====
 * Binary file, big-endian integers.
 * Starts with TOC:
 *   4 Signature = "\0SVL"
 *   4 TOC length, ie offset to Main Segment. >=16. (includes Signature and itself, so <8 doesn't make sense).
 *   4 Main segment length.
 *   4 Audio segment length.
 *   ... Additional TOC space reserved for future use. Safe to ignore.
 * Followed by Main segment, a WebAssembly module.
 * Followed by Audio segment, a WebAssembly module.
