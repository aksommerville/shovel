/* io.h
 * Generic abstraction for video, audio, and input drivers.
 * Our native builds have a single-driver model: You pick a driver at build time, and it's the only one.
 * That's considerably less flexible than my usual pick-at-runtime model, but also much simpler.
 * The goal for shovel is to keep things as small as possible.
 *
 * The interfaces declared here are implemented by driver units.
 * You must select exactly one each of audio, video, and input.
 * 'macos' and 'mswin' provide all three.
 * The more a-la-carte units are named "a_*" for audio, "v_*" for video, and "i_*" for input.
